PixelHeat, an experimental tool that aims to interact with multiple AI agents to manage and streamline your workflow. This project is an exercise in pushing the boundaries of what AI can do in the realm of software development. It's like auto-gpt but not nearly
as nice :)

## Features
* Built with Go
* Interactions with multiple AI agents
* Reads and edits local file contents
* Tracks Git file status and prepares them for PR review
* Tracks API cost

## Experimental
Please note that this is an experimental project. It's not meant to be taken too seriously â€“ it's a fun exploration of AI possibilities. The majority of this project is written by AI, including this Readme.md, which means there will inevitably be some quirks and unexpected behavior.

## Future Work
We are currently working towards expanding the capabilities of PixelHeat, with future updates aiming to include:
* Enhanced interactions with multiple AI agents
* Advanced local file editing capabilities
* Automated Git commit and PR review preparation

## How It Works
Input your task and PixelHeat will delegate it to the appropriate AI agent. You'll receive an output from the agent, which could include edits to local files, Git commit preparations, and more.

## Get Started
```bash
OPENAI_KEY=<key> ./pixelheat
```
